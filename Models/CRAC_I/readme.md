This xpp file was used for the simulations in R. Bertram, P. Smolen, A. Sherman, D. Mears, I. Atwater, F. Martin, and B. Soria. 1995. A role for calcium-release activated current (CRAC) in cholinergic modulation of electrical activity in pancreatic beta-cells. Biophys. J. 68:2323-2332.

The paper showed that CRAC could account for the effects of acetylcholine to potentiate electrical activity as well as biphasic activity when glucose is elevated from basal.
