Evidence that calcium release-activated current mediates transient glucose-induced electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. J. Membr. Bio., 155:47-59.  [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9002424/).  

The paper experimentally tested the prediction of [CRAC_I](https://github.com/artielbm/artielbm.github.io/tree/master/Models/CRAC_I) that depletion of the ER in basal glucose was responsible for the transient first phase of electrical activity when glucose is elevated.
