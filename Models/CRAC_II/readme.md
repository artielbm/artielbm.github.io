Evidence that calcium release-activated current mediates transient glucose-induced electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. J. Membr. Bio., 155:47-59.  [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9002424/).  

The paper showed that depletion of the ER could account for the first phase of electrical activity when glucose is elevated from basal and tested the prediction experimentally.
