Reduced DOM Metabolic oscillations persist in diazoxide (Figure 2). Oscillations do not persist if JGK is raised to 0.153.  [[Fig2.ode]](Fig2.ode)

Reduced DOM Metabolic oscillations rescued by raising Ca (Figure 3). No rescue if JGK is raised to 0.19.  [[Fig3.ode]](Fig3.ode)

Forced GO Phase portrait of the glycolityc oscillator forced by Ca (Figure 5). [[Fig5.ode]](Fig5.ode)

Dual Phase Plane Model Ca-dependent metabolic oscillations in the dual phase-plane model (Figure 6).  [[Fig6.ode]](Fig6.ode)
