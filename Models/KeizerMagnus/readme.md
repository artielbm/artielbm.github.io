### Keizer-Magnus Model

Adapted from J. Keizer and G. Magnus. Biophys J. 1989 56(2):229-42 [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2673420/).

This model has played a foundational role in succeeding mathematical models as the first to propose that bursting in beta cells is driven by calcium indirectly through its effect on the ATP/ADP ratio.  Here, calcium inhibits mitochondrial ATP production.  In other models descending from this one, calcium primarily increases ATP consumption by calcium pumps, but the dynamics are very similar.
