The xpp files below were used in Bertram and Sherman, *A calcium based phantom bursting model for pancreatic beta-cells*, Bull. Math. Biol., 66:1313-1344 2004. [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11106596/)

XPP files by figure:

* Basic Model (Figure 1; like Chay-Keizer negative feedback through cytosolic calcium only)

* Basic Model with Slow Calcium (Figure 3; Chay-Keizer with slow cytosolic calcium)

* ER Model - Fast Mode (Figure 6; model with cytosolic and ER calcium)

* ER Model - Medium Mode (Figure 8; model with cytosolic and ER calcium)

* ER Model - Addition of ACh (Figure 9; Store dumped but no ROC or SOC)

* ER Model - Muscarinic Bursting (Figure 11; Store dumped and ROC activated)

* ER/ATP Model - Slow Mode (Figure 13; c, cer, and a included)

* ER/ATP Model - Addition of Tg (Figure 14; medium bursting converted to fast by SERCA blockade)

* ER/ATP Model - Addition of Tg (Figure 15; slow bursting persists in face of SERCA blockade)

* ER/ATP Model - Triphasic Response to Glucose (Figure 16)

* ER/ATP Model - Addition of Tg and Tolbutamide (Figure 17; slow bursting persists in presence of both thapsigargin and tolbutamide)

Master file
* Combined Model (Choose File/Get set to get all three models and fast/medium/slow bursting). [[biophan.ode]](biophan.ode)
