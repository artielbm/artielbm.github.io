These models have a slow, V-dependent K+ channel to drive bursting. They are based on Sherman and Rinzel, PNAS 89:2471-2474, 1992 [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1549611/)
and also used in A. Sherman. 1994. Anti-phase, asymmetric, and aperiodic oscillations in excitable cells I. Coupled bursters. Bull. Math. Biol. 56:811-835.  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7920266/)
