xpp file for the Smolen-Keier model, in which bursting is driven mainly by calcium-mediated inhibition of ATP production in the mitochondria, as first proposed in the Keizer-Magnus model https://github.com/artielbm/artielbm.github.io/edit/master/Models/KeizerMagnus/readme.md [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2673420/).  This was a starting point for a bursting model with more elaborated mitochondrial dynamics [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9575814/)
