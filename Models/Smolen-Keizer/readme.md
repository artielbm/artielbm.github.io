In this model, bursting is driven mainly by calcium-mediated inhibition of ATP production in the mitochondria, as first proposed in the Keizer-Magnus model  [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2673420/).  xpp code can be found here: [[Keizer-Magnus]](https://github.com/artielbm/artielbm.github.io/edit/master/Models/Smolen-Keizer/readme.md)

It was also the starting point for a bursting model with more elaborated mitochondrial dynamics [[PubMed]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9575814/).
